Decrypt with DVDFab to your hard disk &#8211; rip either the Main Movie or the whole disk. I'm sure one of these options will still be available after the &#8216;trial' period expires

handbrake to encode  
Start with the Apple TV3 preset  
Video tab &#8211; change framerate to same as source (just because it seems sensible to me)  
Audio tab &#8211; should be all OK, The aim is two tracks  
Dolby ProLogic II stereo track (if there are stereo and surround tracks on the source, I tend to downmix from the 5.1 source)  
AC3 Surround passthru track &#8211; for surround sound with a A/V receiver or 5.1 soundcard  
SubTitles &#8211; for non-English films  
Add a subtitle. i prefer not to burn it into the output, so I can let my player (VLC) choose font sizes  
However, often the subtitles are stored on the disc as images, rendered using a hideous font.  
Detect this using the Preview feature of handbrake. If it is the case, I leave this subtitle track in place, so I can compare  
the accuracy of the SRT based track I add next.  
Download an SRT subtitle file (try http://www.subtitles.com.br or google!)  
Add the track, make it default  
Preview again, playing the video in turn with each subtitle track. This should give you some info about the time accuracy of the SRT file  
Because you can't guarantee the accuracy for the duration of the film, I leave on the original pixellated subtitle, so I can switch to it  
if the SRT turns out to be inaccurate
