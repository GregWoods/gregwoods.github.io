! TODO

* Add commenting engine, and somehow re-add good comments form wordpress site.
  Not sure this is possible unless I hardcode them, or create some gwguest account with disqus (or whoever)

* adjust spacing in header (main.scss probably)

* ?is it worth tweaking the font sizes? They are generally too big. Test on mobile first.

* Review drafts. publish (with old dates)

* Write new material

* [LOW] tidyup the markdown
