**Shower screens not quite big enough to stop soaking the floor**  
I don't really need to say anything more about that.

**Similarities to Software Development**  
I cannot tell whether the problems are:

  1. Irrelevant... no-one cares but me
  2. The fault of cost-cutting
  3. The fault of architects or interior designers who prefer minimal over usable

However, it needs to stop.  
The problems are similar to those in software development. We have a paying customer, and we have users. 

Customer: I want feature X. It must do this that and the other.  
Developer: Ok, that will cost 25units of time.  
Customer: Ooo, we need it done in 15, we have a deadline  
Developer: We could, but it won't be as nice to use  
Customer: We'll go with the 15 option

Now, a grumpy software developer is of no concern to the paying customers. But when the customer's customers get grumpy because of bad design - that will cost sales.
