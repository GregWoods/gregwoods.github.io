Having lost my old Samsung Galaxy (the original i7500 on Android 1.6), I decided to keep a log of software I install. It turns out the market only remembers stuff you purchase, not everything you had installed. This list may provide a shortcut to others who need to use their Android handset in a semi-useful manner.

## Phone: Orange San Francisco aka ZTE Blade

### Custom ROM

#### Step1 - Install ClockworkMod recovery

Why? To remove Orange branding and give a more default Android experience.  
ClockworkMod Recovery adds a new ROM management utility to the boot up options when you boot with VolDown + Power  
Once installed, Vol-/+ to navigate, home to select  
Allows install of new ROMs from a packaged up zip file on the SD card.  
Note: You need to know if your device is OLED or LCD screen (newer ones are LCD), and ensure the ROM is compatible. Phone Build Numbers ending ‘08’ are LCD

I used:  
`r7_update_de-orangeated_lite_blade_signed.zip`(also ‘roots’ the phone)  
Followed by  
`r7_update_de-orangeated_fat_addon_blade_signed.zip`  
see modaco for instructions on installing clockwordmodrecovery, and then downloading the roms.

### Essential (for me)

**Blade WiFi Fix** - auto disables then enables wifi to fix a bug in the phone  
Auto Wifi Enabler - Only turns on Wifi when in a certain (coarse) geographic area. I can leave WiFi on all the time now.  
**Calendar Pad** - utterly essential - shows text in your calendar instead of meaningless coloured lines  
**Astrid** - useful task manager if you use Google Tasks (which is slowly becoming useful)  
**Catch Notes** - because I use the web version  
**BeamReader PDF Viewer** (Purchased) - the best PDF viewer, though I’ve not checked out Adobe’s offering in a while  
**Twidroyd** - because you need a dose of Twitter  
**Dropbox** - because you can!  
**Advanced Task Killer** - occasionally useful  
Flash 10.1 - for a dose of TekPub - doesn’t work on the Blade for some reason<img src="https://gregwoods.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> http://www.addictivetips.com/mobile/how-to-install-flash-10-1-on-android-2-1-eclair-devices/

### Navigation

**Maverick Pro** (Purchased) - Great for recording tracklogs, and supports loads of maps, including Open Piste Map. UPDATE: some features, like saving track logs as GPX files appears unavailable for phones without a 5way D-Pad or trackball<img src="https://gregwoods.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  
**Maps (-)** - great for pre-caching vector map data before you go on holiday and incur a huge data bill  
**RMaps** - like google maps, but with more source map data options. Functionality probably overlaps with Maverick now I’ve bought that.  
**Street View on Google Maps** - not tried yet, but why wouldn’t you install it!  
**My Maps Editor by Google** - unsure of it’s usefulness at the moment  
**Google Sky Map** - because it’s just awesome to show off with!

### Security, Backup

**Lost Phone** - if not this, then PLEASE install something that allows you to remotely lock, turn on GPS tracking, or make the phone sound an alarm. SMS controlled.  
**SMS Backup +** - because WHEN you lose your phone, it’s nice to have your SMSs backed up automatically to gmail.  
**Titanium Backup** - trying it out. Saving to SD at the moment, which is useful when ROM swapping. Premum version supports Dropbox, which is more useful for a stolen phone.

### Utilities

**Barcode Scanner** - essential for QR codes - this one works really well  
**Show and Switch 2G** - Useful in marginal 3G signal areas, or to save battery. This one switches from the notifications bar, with additional icon to show network type  
**Switch Network Type** - as above, but no additional icon

### Novelty & Untested

**Instant Heart Rate** - interesting use of the camera!  
**Picasa Tool Pro** - untested  
**Pkt Auctions Ebay** - easier than using the web site

### Games

**Angry Birds** - just to keep up with Jones’ (iPhone users!)
